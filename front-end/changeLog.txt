Since Production (not games):

v1.1.4
- Changes of the how balance and completed quests are stored; now in the cache context.
- Leaderboard skeleton fix.
- Removed redundant lazy loads on images.
- Added error 429 page.
- Fix how the update profile requests didn't abort when needed to.

v1.1.5
- Fixed the quest modal and how they weren't showing complete because of
  the change of how the balance and completed quests are handled.

v1.2.6
- Lots of aria attributes was added; Most is already provided by Chakra UI, but I still had to make tweaks.
- Quest Casino's UI is now fully keyboard accessible!
