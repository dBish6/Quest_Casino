# Quest_Casino_Full-Stack_App
This is a fun little "casino" app that has different kinds of card games. The first being blackjack, which is currently in version 1.5.15 and you can also view the blackjack change log in the rules overlay while playing the game. The app is called _Quest Casino_ and from the sound of the name, in addition, it has some quests/challenges to complete for some extra moolah!

To add, the blackjack game is not your standard simple blackjack game, it has all the functionally you'll think of from a blackjack game by also having sounds and animations. What sets this game apart is the fact that it was developed solely from scratch, without referencing other blackjack game's code. The entire game was conceptualized and implemented using my own creativity and problem-solving skills, making it truly one of a kind, this code is the most unique and genuine as it can get, I hope you enjoy it. As an aspiring developer, I hope my work can inspire you too. Thank you for your interest in my app!

I'm also open to collaborate with anyone who would like to help:) [Contact me here](mailto:davidbish2002@hotmail.com).
