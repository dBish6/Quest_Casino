Since Production:

v1.1.2
- Auth controllers changed for better performance; controllers that get specific fields 
  now uses select() to avoid getting the full document before hand.
- Game route and controller was added to persist the current game session. 
- Fixed auth.dal get all users function.

v1.2.5
- deleteInactiveGameSession was introduced as a scheduled firebase function to delete unused
  game sessions from firestore.
- deleteInactiveProfilePictures fix; The function requires the use of a id in the document,
  but sense I used the document's id itself as the id, I put that id inside the object
  when the document is fetched.
- Re-organized the utils to their respective feature folders.
- Rate-limiting is currently now disabled for games routes because of the repeated requests
  when saving the game sessions and would send a 429 error when playing for a long period it 
  seems.
